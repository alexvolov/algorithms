/**
 * Binary heap is a tree-like data structure that generally can be
 * separated into two types: min-heap and max-heap. The difference
 * is that in the max-heap all nodes are greater than or equal to
 * each of itâ€™s children. In the min-heap everything is vise versa,
 * all nodes are less than or equal to each of its children. Thus,
 * the highest (max-heap) or lowest (min-heap) element is always
 * on the top and this is the main advantage which provides
 * possibility to access the min or the max element in constant time.
 * Another important property is that all levels, except the last
 * last one, must be full.
